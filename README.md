Loan Approval Prediction (ML Project)

Overview:
This project predicts loan approval status based on applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and demographic details using machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.

Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Label Encoding & Feature Scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations (Scatter, Histogram, Countplot, Heatmap)
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Best Model Selection

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

2. Place the dataset 'Loan Prediction Dataset - RAW.csv' in the project folder.

3. Run the script:
   python "Loan Approval Prediction Proj.py"

Output:
- Model Accuracies
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Best Model Name
